# gimp-workprep

A script (possibly evolving into a press button plugin?) to save time when I start in GIMP.

The aim is to quickly throw up two canvas sized layers: one white, one transparent. 

This is my general workflow when I've opened an existing image - a transparent layer for drawing lines on and the white simply for the ability to see them without the checkerboard bleedthrough of the default background. 

Also, possibly adding in the renaming of the initial active layer to something (like 'x') and changing its opacity to 30%.
